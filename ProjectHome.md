FlexRTF is a simple and scalable platform-independent WYSIWYG cross-browser editor, allowing non-technical users easily create, edit and publish valid (x)HTML text via a web interface similar to that of MS Word. Flex RTF editor substitutes HTML text areas and takes only two minutes and few lines of code to equip your site with a powerful editing tool. Being totally platform-independent, the editor can be installed on any site and runs under any browser - be it Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera or other, the only user requirement being Flash plug-in installed on user computer.

**Features**:
  * In-built image upload functionality
  * Table manager tool which allows editing tables, adding/deleting rows/columns
  * Undo/redo action trails
  * Valid XHTML output

If you run a website, where multiple non-technical users create, edit and send for review different types of content, RTF editor will be the perfect solution to minimize user errors and increase your productivity.
